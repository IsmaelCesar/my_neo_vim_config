### NVIM config

I'm learning how to use Neovim and decided to create this repository with my config files. Feel free to copy it and modify it as you please.
The Neovim version I'm using is v0.11.4

To use tressitter plugin, it will be necessary to have rust installed,  which you can do by following the steps on [this page](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/).
Once you have Rust installed, must install the tree-sitter-cli by using the `cargo` command: 
```
cargo install --locked tree-sitter-cli
```
Or, if you're using npm, you can install the `tree-sitter-cli`, by running the following command: 
```
npm install tree-sitter-cli
```

It is important to note that you must also have a C/C++ compiler installed in your machine, such as gcc/g++ or clang.
